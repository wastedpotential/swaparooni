just a weird interactive thingy I built with Pixi.js.

Any images or graphic assets are copyrighted by me. You are not allowed to use them for your projects.

Do not use this as an example of how to build anything. I was just hacking around and slapped this together. It is not built in a way that anyone should ever build anything. In fact, modifying this spaghetti code is more difficult than it looks. If I had to do it again, I would create proper classes that can maintain their own state.

Thanks,
